# Python Challenge

The code contained in this project are my answers to the Python Test.
I have used list comprehension and lambda, and I will be using unit testing to test my code which will follow.

- Requirement 1 is complete.
- Requirement 2 - Almost complete, I still need to output the total rent for all items in the list.
- Requirement 3 - is complete, although I feel I can structure the output form better.
- Requirement 4 - currently in processes.

## Running the script.py

Each function in the script.py can be run separately changing the print command at the bottom of the script, running the script with python3 script.py in the terminal.

## Running the tests

The unit testing is in progress and will follow.

### Break down into end to end tests
